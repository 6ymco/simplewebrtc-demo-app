# SimpleWebRTC Demo

To get started, you will first need to create a `.env.local` file with `API_KEY` set to your API key.

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm start # runs all the demos simultaneously
# Or to run a specific demo
npm start -- <DEMO_NAME>
```

## Setting up Screensharing

For any demos involving screensharing, you will need to manually install this Chrome extension:

For production, a custom extension would be used. [A sample extension is available for you to customize.](https://github.com/andyet/simplewebrtc-screenshare-extension)
